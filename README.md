# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Bot
In this project, a hand gesture controlled robot is developed using MPU6050, which is a 3-axis Accelerometer and 3-axis Gyroscope sensor using I2C communication protocol to communicate with the Arduino. The project is based on wireless communication, where the data from the hand gestures is transmitted to the robot over RF link (RF Transmitter – Receiver pair).
<br />The hardware components used are:
<br />  a. Arduino Uno x1
<br />  b. Arduino Nano x1
<br />  c. MPU6050 Accelerometer Sensor x1
<br />  d. L298N Motor Driver x1
<br />  e. Chassis x1
<br />  f. DC Motor x2
<br />  g. Car wheels x2
<br />  h. Caster Wheel x1
<br />  i. Jumper Wires
<br />  j. 9V Battery x3
<br />  m. Switch x1
<br /> l. 433 MHz RF Transmitter and Receiver module x1
<br />The software used is Arduino IDE 1.8.15 .
<br />Libraries used:- “Wire.h” and “RH_ASK.h”
