# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Bot
In this project, a hand gesture controlled robot is developed using MPU6050, which is a 3-axis Accelerometer and 3-axis Gyroscope sensor using I2C communication protocol to communicate with the Arduino. The project is based on wireless communication, where the data from the hand gestures is transmitted to the robot over RF link (RF Transmitter â€“ Receiver pair).
